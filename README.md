# Logistic-Regression-for-Image

A step-by-step logistic regression implementation in Python for classifying cat vs non-cat images.

- All weights are initialized to zero.
- Avoiding loops as much as possible by using NUMPY.
- Illustrating forward and backward propagation.
- Analyzing the effect of learning rate.

## Note that it maight suffer from overfitting! ##
